I’m excited to announce that the "minecraft-hardcore-100-days-backup-public-share-map" is going to be published on GitHub for everyone to enjoy and create with!

This world is my own custom hardcore survival map where I challenge myself to survive for 100 days on a Minecraft 1.8.8 island, and I’m sharing it with the community for anyone who wants to explore, build, and experience the journey on their own.

The map will be available as a separate file, and I will continue to update it every time I back up my world, ensuring that you always have access to the latest version of the island and my progress.

Feel free to follow my progress as I update the world, and you can see how I survive, gather resources, build structures, and overcome the challenges that come with a hardcore survival mode.

You’ll get access to each backup, and I encourage you to check back regularly to see how things are evolving and what new elements have been added to the world.

The backup files will be made public, so you’re welcome to check out my latest changes and see how I’m tackling the unique challenges of surviving for 100 days on a tough island.

When you spawn into the world, you’ll be given a map to help you navigate and avoid getting lost on the island—perfect for exploring, finding resources, and keeping track of your progress.

The map will be a valuable tool for guiding you when you're lost or need to find your way back to your base, making your survival experience smoother and more enjoyable.

I’ll be hosting the map on my GitHub repository, so you can easily download and get started right away with the most recent version.

Just to clarify, when I say you can create with me, I mean you can play separately—this is a shared experience where you can enjoy the map, explore, and create in your own way, but without multiplayer features.

Stay tuned, and enjoy the experience of surviving on this hardcore island with me as I share my journey, and feel free to explore, build, and create your own adventures in this survival world!
